# COVID-666
There has been a new virus outbreak and it is very important to keep track of its spread. 
Hence, I took up the challenge to save the world.

I get on my computer and started writing an application for the same. 
But since time is key and I want my application to be up as soon as possible, I decided to ignore all the good code practises and ended up doing a code vomit. 
Thanks to that I was able to bring up my application in a single day.

It does the following tasks - 
 1. Add a new patient
 2. Update the status of a patient.
 3. Get patient information.
 4. Count the number of patients by country, state, city, status.

It has a been a few weeks and my application works great, but now I want to add more features to it, to help people better fight the pandemic

1. Add multiple interfaces to ingest data (http, grpc, kafka etc)
2. Add a Persistent datastore (Mysql, Cassandra, Dynamodb etc)
3. Support Other Filters in my query. eg - 
	a. Get all patients who are active for more than 14 days
	b. Get all countries/states/cities with less than 100 cases.
4. Provide visualizations.
5. Add a feature for contract tracing.
6. Add support for animals. (No being is safe)
7. Increase performance, availability of my application. Will the application scale for 10 billion patients. 
8. Is my code thread safe ??

I go back to my code to add these new features, but soon I realise its an impossible task because of the code vomit I did earlier. 

Now I am looking for code heroes around the world to help me fix it and save the world. Are you up for the challenge ??
